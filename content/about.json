      "bio": "How do we expand upon the standard? That is the constant question that lingers in Evan Rene's mind! Film is a creative medium that has thrived in pop culture. Amazing trends have started and bad trends have come from it. Evan's goal isn't to completely revitalize the film industry or even bring it back to its former self. Evan's goal is to make art count and to tell compelling thought-provoking stories through filmmaking & photography.",
